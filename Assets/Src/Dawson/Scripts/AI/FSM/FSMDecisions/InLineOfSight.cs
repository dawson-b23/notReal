/*
 *  This class decides if the player is in the AI's line of sight. This is slightly trickier in 2D
 *  versus 3D becuase the lack of the transform forward direction. This gets AI position at previous frame,
 *  and allows a new forward direction along x-axis to be calculated at current time. This is for ray casting. 
 *
 *  member variables:
 *
 *  layerMask          -  Only objects thatâ€™s been placed on that layer in Unity editor will be detected while others rejected
 *  distanceThreshould -  checks to see if player is in this distance, "vision/sight range"
 *  prevPosition       -  collaborate with each other to ensure this information at every frame
 *  prevDirection      -  collaborate with each other to ensure this information at every frame
