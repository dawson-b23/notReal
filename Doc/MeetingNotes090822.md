# Group Meeting Notes 

##  Order of Business 

 1. Reviewing Project Contributions
 2. Game Ideas
 3. Going over what's due and upcoming
 
## Reviewing Project Contributions 

After some discussion we moved some of the programming roles of individual members around, see the official roles .md file to see the changes. Everyone has expressed that they should have enough to meet the minimum requirements of the class. 

The requirements for the implemented features for the oral exam:

- Your code must function the way the client has requested.
- Your code must be approximately equal (or greater) in work requirement to your team mates.
-   You must have at least two patterns and be able to justify their use.
-   Your documentation must match your code.
-   You must comply with your team's coding standards.

## Game Brainstorming Ideas

Some general ideas that came up from the meeting:

- Money = score/currency of the game 
- Dying results in starting the game over
- Final boss (maybe secret boss) could be a human 
- "Main" final boss is a big ass spider
- Neutral feel to the game, won't be classified as mature or kids game 

Game story:

- game starts in the hive where you are introduced to Queen BC 
	- she tasks you with saving the hive and fighting to the exit, clearing all the enemies along the way 
		- you can say yes or say no (if no the game ends on the spot as an Easter egg)
- The game will be set up into "tiles" that the player progresses through, giving different procedurally generated areas. 
	- Some possibilities 
		- A room where you Get a free weapon and have to clear the enemies 
		- A timed survival room 
		- shopkeep area where you can buy more health, weapons, etc
		- treasure room
		- trap room 
		- Mini boss / elite rooms
		- an "empty room" where you can see destruction of the hive and have a "somewhat useless" interaction with an npc
		- Final Boss room(s)
