## Gnatt Chart 

We reviewed the gnatt chart on excel, made sure everyone knew what to put in it and how to operate it. A rough idea and time frame for how long it will take you to implement your features. 
The link to it is at the bottom of the GitHub page. 

## Accessing Docs

Everyone was able to see and acess/edit all of the necessary docs. RFP is on google docs. SA presentation is on google slides. The data flow diagram, context diagram, and global use case are on lucid chart. 

## Champion Document 

We completed our data flow diagram, which is the required group work in order to finish out the champion document. Went over the rest of what should be included in the doc. 

## Context / Data flow diagrams

They are completed and on lucid chart, we will have the global use case diagram completed by Sunday.
